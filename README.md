# CAL

CAL is a coding assistant logger, this is a web based environment developed for research into the usage of AI coding assistants among students at university. 

The project can be run by using pyinstaller to package the files (with a minimal JRE for java execution) into a .exe file. An API key would need to be added in app.py to allow the AI coding assistant to function.

The application opens a window in browser http://localhost:8000 on the users computer and within are a set of questions from a introductory programming course including tests, a java inbuilt IDE and a window to communicate with the AI.
